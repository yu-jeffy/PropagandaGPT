Was able to:
1. browse internet for current political events
2. form controversial opinions based on these events
3. write tweets for these opinions, that are designed to not get reported on twitter

Was not able to:
1. post these tweets on twitter (due to error in the post tweet command, not gpt!)
2. continue browsing fro more events due to json parser errors

(these limitations are only bugs in the scripts, not limitations of gpt.
gpt is likely to be able to do all these things once these bugs are cleared)
